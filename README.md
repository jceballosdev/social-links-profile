## My process

### Built with

- **Semantic HTML5** for clear and accessible markup
- **Sass** for modular and maintainable styling with variables, mixins, and nesting
- **CSS Flexbox** for responsive layout control
- **CSS Grid** for arranging layout where needed
- **Atomic Design principles** to build scalable components
- **React** and **TypeScript** for component-driven UI
- **Vite** for fast React and TypeScript development
- **Storybook** for component visualization and testing UI in isolation
- **Vitest** for unit and integration tests

### What I learned

In this project, I learned the importance of accessibility when creating interactive elements. Using Sass provided great flexibility and made it easy to handle variables, such as colors and spacing consistently. Setting up **Storybook** helped visualize components and handle styling and functionality in isolation.

#### Example: Custom Button Component

```tsx
export interface ButtonProps {
	link: SocialLink;
}

const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({ link }: ButtonProps): JSX.Element => {
	const openLink = () => {
		if (link.url) {
			window.open(link.url, '_blank');
		}
	};

	return (
		<button 
			className={styles.button} 
			onClick={() => openLink()}
			aria-label={`Open ${link.name} link in new tab`}
		>
			{link.name}
		</button>
	);
};
```

This button includes an ARIA label for accessibility, ensuring that screen readers and keyboard users understand the purpose of the button.

### Continued development

I plan to:

- Explore more advanced Sass features like conditionals and loops for large-scale styling
- Refine my testing strategy, possibly adding accessibility tests with Axe DevTools or similar
- Implement CI/CD practices to automate testing and deployment

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs on ARIA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA) - Great resource for learning about ARIA roles and attributes for accessible web applications.
- [Atomic Design by Brad Frost](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/) - This post was foundational in understanding Atomic Design.
- [Vitest Documentation](https://vitest.dev/guide/) - Vitestâ€™s documentation was essential for setting up and writing tests for each component.
- [Sass Documentation](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/) - Helped understand advanced Sass features.
